# Varietyz Bot (ONGOING PROJECT)

**Advanced Discord Bot for OSRS Clan Management & Competitive Event Automation**

**Varietyz Bot** is a high-performance Discord bot built specifically for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) clans. It automates RSN (RuneScape Name) registration, dynamic role assignments, real-time activity tracking, and interactive competitions—including a cutting-edge Bingo event system. Engineered with a modular architecture, robust data integrity practices, and seamless Discord integration, Varietyz Bot exemplifies modern, scalable software design.

## Overview

Varietyz Bot empowers OSRS clans by:

- **Automating RSN Management:** Secure registration and continuous synchronization of player names via the Wise Old Man API.
- **Dynamic Role Assignments:** Automatically updating Discord roles based on in-game milestones and player activity.
- **Real-Time Competitions:** Running weekly contests (e.g., Skill of the Week and Boss of the Week) with live leaderboard updates.
- **Innovative Bingo Events:** Generating dynamic 3x5 task-based Bingo boards that track progress and reward strategic gameplay.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Using an optimized SQLite database for persistence with automated maintenance and archival routines.
- **Seamless Discord Sync:** Continuously reflecting game data through live embeds, notifications, and even voice channel indicators.

This project demonstrates advanced event-driven design, efficient asynchronous processing, and a modular, scalable approach to real-time data management.

## Technical Architecture

Varietyz Bot is architected around **decoupled, purpose-driven modules**, leveraging Node.js and Discord.js to deliver real-time functionality with a clean separation of concerns.

### Core Modules

| **Module**                  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VarietyzBot`               | Central plugin logic, lifecycle management, and orchestration of commands, events, and scheduled tasks.                                                          |
| `RSNManagementModule`       | Handles secure registration, validation, and real-time synchronization of RuneScape names using the Wise Old Man API.                                            |
| `RoleAndActivityEngine`     | Automates role assignments based on in-game achievements, tracks player activity, and dynamically updates Discord roles and statuses.                            |
| `BingoEventManager`         | Manages the full lifecycle of Bingo events: dynamically generating 3x5 Bingo boards, tracking task completions, recognizing patterns, and awarding bonus points. |
| `TaskGeneratorAndScheduler` | Randomly selects tasks from a configurable pool and schedules precise API polling to update event progress continuously.                                         |
| `DatabaseUtilities`         | Provides abstractions over SQLite operations with transactional updates, integrity checks, and routine maintenance for persistent data storage.                  |
| `DiscordSyncManager`        | Coordinates live synchronization with Discord – updating embeds, leaderboards, and voice channel statuses in real time.                                          |
| `APIClients`                | Dedicated clients for external API interactions (e.g., Wise Old Man API) with rate limiting and retry logic to ensure robust data fetching.                      |

### Supporting Structures

- **Configuration & Dependency Injection:**  
  Centralized configuration via environment variables and config files. Dependencies are injected to ensure that each module remains decoupled and easily testable.

- **Logging & Error Handling:**  
  Comprehensive logging with Winston captures every significant operation and error, supporting transparent monitoring and rapid debugging.

## Advanced Engineering Features

**Stateful RSN & Session Management:**

- Securely registers RSNs, validates them against the WOM API, and auto-updates changes in near real time.
- Supports multiple accounts per Discord user and performs regular cleanups of inactive data.

**Dynamic Role Assignments & Activity Tracking:**

- Automatically assigns roles based on skill milestones, boss kills, and other in-game achievements.
- Continuously monitors player activity to update statuses and voice channel indicators dynamically.

**Real-Time Competitions & Leaderboards:**

- Hosts weekly competitions (Skill of the Week / Boss of the Week) that rotate automatically, with live leaderboard updates delivered via interactive Discord embeds.

**Innovative Bingo Event System:**

- Generates a fresh 3x5 Bingo board for each event with randomized tasks.
- Tracks task progress and recognizes predefined patterns (rows, diagonals, full board) to award bonus points.
- Supports both individual and team play, with intelligent point distribution based on contribution.

**Robust Database Management:**

- Employs an optimized SQLite database with enforced constraints and transactional operations to ensure data consistency.
- Implements automated maintenance routines (archival, cleanup, backup) to keep data lean and reliable.

**Seamless Discord Synchronization:**

- Uses Discord.js to sync all data in near real time, updating roles, embeds, and status channels instantly as game data changes.
