# Baneâ€™s Lab â€“ Jay Baleine's Portfolio Web Platform (ONGOING PROJECT)

**Professional Digital Showcase for Full-Stack Engineering, Creative Systems & OSRS Ecosystem Tools**

**banes-lab.com** is a meticulously engineered portfolio website that merges technical depth with artistic presentation. Featuring dynamic project galleries, modular component design, and real-time GitHub integration, this site demonstrates full-stack proficiency across React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub APIs, and interactive UI patterns.

The platform serves as a living resume and project showcase for frontend/backend engineering, graphics/UI design, and developer tools in the OSRS (Old School RuneScape) community and beyond.

---

## Overview

Baneâ€™s Lab empowers discovery and engagement through:

- **Dynamic Project Rendering:** GitHub-powered repository cards with live README previews (public and private).
- **Visual Graphics Galleries:** Categorized design showcases with modal zoom, tags, and lazy-loaded assets.
- **Component-Based Layout:** Reusable Tailwind/React UI primitives optimized for maintainability.
- **Custom CSS/Markdown Theming:** Branded dark-mode prose and scroll-free layouts for immersive reading.
- **Performance-First Architecture:** Minimal bundle sizes via Vite, lazy loading, and zero external libraries except Keen Slider.

## Technical Architecture

**banes-lab.com** is built using a **modular React + Tailwind stack**, with clearly separated concerns across:

| **Module**           | **Purpose**                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `App.jsx`            | Root router and layout scaffold with global background and animated content. |
| `pages/`             | Route-level screens: `Home`, `Graphics`, `Development`, `About`, `Contact`.  |
| `components/ui/`     | Reusable components: `Button`, `Modal`, `RepositoryCard`, `Slider`.          |
| `components/layout/` | Site-wide layout: `Header`, `Navbar`, `Footer`.                              |
| `data/`              | Precompiled structured data (images, project metadata, repo config).         |
| `hooks/`             | Custom React hooks: `useInView`, `useScrollDirection` for UX enhancements.   |
| `utils/`             | Utility functions for GitHub API integration and reusable logic.             |
| `styles/`            | Custom stylesheets: `globals.css`, `custom.css`, `markdown.css`.             |

## Key Engineering Features

### Development Project Showcase (GitHub Integrated)

- Fetches live public repos via GitHub API and merges with hand-curated private repo data.
- Displays repo metadata (`name`, `desc`, `lang`, `privacy`) with interactive modal to render Markdown README.
- Uses `remark-gfm` + `ReactMarkdown` for GitHub-flavored rendering and local fallback support.

### Graphic Design Galleries (Lazy Loaded + Categorized)

- Auto-generated UI using metadata from `/data/graphicsData.js`.
- Supports 10+ folders: _Droptracker_, _Enigma Esports_, _Varietyz Deluxe_, _RoseyRS_, and more.
- Responsive grid layout with modal image zoom (via Keen Slider) and scroll-based reveal animations.

### Modular React Components

- Clean, atomic component structure (e.g., `RepositoryCard`, `Modal`, `Button`) with semantic Tailwind classes.
- Enables reusability and maintainability across pages.
- Lazy zoom support and keyboard accessibility baked into UI.

### Custom Hooks & Animations

- `useInView`: Uses IntersectionObserver to fade galleries on scroll.
- `useScrollDirection`: Detects user scroll direction with throttle logic.
- `globals.css`: Custom slide-in animations, global dark mode layout, and scroll disabling.

### Design Fidelity & Markdown Styling

- Tailored `.markdown-body` styles using `Cinzel` + `Montserrat`, with full support for tables, code blocks, links.
- Matches visual identity across prose, modal, and interactive elements.

---

## Scalability & Maintainability

### Component-Centric Design

- Clear folder structure for pages, components, hooks, data, and styles.
- Easy to add new projects, folders, or UI components without impacting core logic.

### Performance Optimization

- Vite + Tailwind JIT = lightning-fast HMR and production builds.
- Purged CSS via correct Tailwind config with safelist for dynamic background classes.
- All images organized under `/public/assets/images/` for centralized management.

### Deployment-Ready

- Git-tracked build structure with `.vscode/settings.json`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`.
- FTP-ready deployment via one.com with `public` and `dist` separation.
- Uses clean URLs via React Router for SEO friendliness.

---

## Business & Professional Value

This site demonstrates:

- **End-to-End System Ownership:** From design to deployment, everything is handled in-houseâ€”no scaffolds, no dependencies on UI libraries beyond Tailwind.
- **Data-Driven Portfolio Strategy:** Combines live code from GitHub with refined markdown storytelling, appealing to both engineers and creatives.
- **Real-World Engineering Practices:** Component reuse, API integration, markdown parsing, error handling, hooks-based logic.
- **Accessible Branding Execution:** Every element is branded and polishedâ€”fonts, backgrounds, borders, colors.

## Conclusion

**banes-lab.com** is more than a portfolioâ€”itâ€™s a **working showcase of modular React engineering**, **systematic design thinking**, and **pragmatic web development**. Built to scale, adapt, and impress, itâ€™s the type of project that speaks directly to recruiters, engineers, and business stakeholders.

Letâ€™s connect to discuss how this level of attention to modularity, UI/UX polish, and system-level thinking can elevate your next product or platform.
