## Terms of Service

### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Banes-Lab website and services (“Platform”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access the Platform. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you must not use the Platform.

### 2. Description of Service

Banes-Lab is a personal portfolio and project platform showcasing graphic designs, programming projects, and offering interactive features such as a web chat interface linked with a Discord server (the “Service”). The Service includes the main website (**banes-lab.com**) and related subdomains (such as the WebSocket chat endpoint at **ws.banes-lab.com**). Any new features or tools which are added to the current Service will also be subject to these Terms.

### 3. Accounts and Authentication

You may browse portions of the site without an account, but certain interactive features (e.g. participating in the chat or receiving updates) require you to log in via a third-party OAuth provider (Discord, Google, or GitHub). By authenticating, you certify that the information provided (your profile info from the provider) is accurate and that you have the right to use the account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your third-party account credentials; Banes-Lab never receives your password and cannot access your third-party account on your behalf beyond the provided OAuth token. If you suspect unauthorized use of your Banes-Lab session (for example, if you believe your `token` cookie or OAuth token has been compromised), you should terminate the session (log out or revoke access) and notify me. I may terminate or suspend your access to the Service if you violate these Terms or if i detect any security risks to the Service or other users.

### 4. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Platform in accordance with the following rules and all applicable laws and regulations. **You may not:**

- **Interfere with the Platform’s operation or security.**  
  This includes attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network, breaching security or authentication measures without proper authorization, or introducing malware or harmful code into the website. Any form of hacking, DDoS attacks, or exploitation of the Platform is strictly prohibited.

- **Misuse the interactive features.**  
  The Platform’s chat and any future community features are provided for constructive communication. You must not use them to harass, bully, or defame others; to transmit unlawful, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; or to spam (send repetitive or unsolicited messages/content). Impersonating any person or entity or misrepresenting your affiliation is not allowed.

- **Engage in prohibited commercial activities.**  
  The Platform is non-commercial. You may not advertise products or services, solicit other users’ information for commercial purposes, or conduct any sales or fundraising on the Platform without explicit permission. Additionally, scraping or harvesting content or personal data from the site (automated or otherwise) for commercial use is forbidden.

- **Violate any third-party rights.**  
  Do not upload or share content that you do not have the right to share or that infringes upon any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any party. This also includes not violating Discord’s, Google’s, or GitHub’s terms when you use those services to log in or interact with Banes-Lab.

By using the Platform, you also agree to adhere to any guidelines or rules posted in specific sections of the site. I reserve the right to moderate, edit, or remove any user-submitted content (such as chat messages) that i deem to violate these rules or to be inappropriate, at my sole discretion. Repeated violations may result in suspension or banning from the chat or the entire Platform.

### 5. User Content and Intellectual Property

Any content that you contribute to the Platform (for example, messages you post via the chat) remains your intellectual property, but by posting you grant Banes-Lab a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute that content on the Platform as needed to operate the service. This license is only for the purpose of operating or improving the Service. I do not claim ownership of your contributions and you can request removal of your content at any time.

Banes-Lab itself, including all original content on the site (text, images, code snippets, designs), is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You must not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the Banes-Lab site content unless expressly authorized by me. “Bane’s Lab” and associated logos or designs are trademarks of the site owner. You are not permitted to use these marks without permission.

### 6. External Links and Third-Party Content

The Platform may contain links to third-party websites or display content (e.g. GitHub project information, embedded Discord widgets, or external font assets). These are provided for convenience or functionality. I do not have control over third-party sites and thus cannot assume responsibility for their content, terms, or privacy practices. For example, if the site displays your GitHub repositories via the GitHub API or links to an external project page, those are subject to GitHub’s terms. By using these features, you acknowledge that third-party content is outside of Banes-Lab’s control and you agree that Banes-Lab will not be liable for any issues arising from your use of third-party websites or services. I encourage you to review the terms of any third-party service you access.

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Banes-Lab Platform is provided on an **“as is” and “as available”** basis. While i strive for a high-quality, secure experience, i cannot guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. **You use the Platform at your own risk.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, Banes-Lab (and its owner/operator) disclaims all warranties, express or implied, in connection with the Service and your use thereof. This includes, but is not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

Banes-Lab does not warrant that:

1. the Platform will meet your specific requirements or expectations,
2. the Platform will be available at any particular time or location,
3. any defects or errors will be corrected, or
4. the results of using the Platform (such as learning outcomes, project exposure, etc.) will be satisfactory.

Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is accessed at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or loss of data that results.

### 8. Limitation of Liability

To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Banes-Lab or its owner be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, data loss, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) the Platform. In particular, Banes-Lab is not responsible for:

- any content posted by users or third parties,
- any damage resulting from malware, viruses, or the like that might be transmitted to or through my site by any third party,
- the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or
- any matters beyond my reasonable control, such as outages or failures of web hosting, telecommunications, or integrations with third-party services.

My total liability for all claims arising from use of the Service will not exceed the amount (if any) you have paid to me for the use of the Service or \$100 USD, whichever is less. **Your sole remedy** in case of dissatisfaction with the Service is to stop using it.  
_(Note: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation/exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.)_

### 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Banes-Lab and its owner from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Platform, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity.

### 10. Termination

You may stop using the Platform at any time. I reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service (including banning you from the chat or the entire site) at my discretion, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms or if i suspect your use of the Service may cause legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Service. Upon termination, the provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will remain in effect (including sections on Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranties, Intellectual Property, and Governing Law).

### 11. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Belgium**, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the Service or these Terms that cannot be resolved amicably shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Belgium. If you reside outside of Belgium, you consent to the personal jurisdiction of Belgian courts for the purpose of litigating such disputes, and you agree that any judgment obtained in such courts may be enforced in your local jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, Banes-Lab retains the right to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

### 12. Changes to Terms

I may modify these Terms from time to time. If i make material changes, i will provide advance notice to users (for example, by posting a notification on the website or via an email if you have provided one). The revised Terms will be effective as of the indicated “Last updated” date or any later date specified. By continuing to access or use the Platform after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.

### 13. Contact Information

If you have any questions about these Terms or the Privacy Policy, or if you need to contact me for any reason, please email **jay@banes-lab.com**. I value your feedback and are committed to addressing any concerns.
