Welcome to the **Varietyz Members List** 🎉, an interactive OSRS clan viewer powered by our custom API connection. This page displays all clan members along with their metrics.

Use the **search bar** 🔍 to quickly filter members by **username** or **rank**. When only one result is found, pressing `Enter` will open that member’s full profile on Wise Old Man in a new tab.

Each member card shows:
- **🧍 Name** with the corresponding **🎖️ Rank Badge**
- **📈 Overall XP** – If a member is not registered on our discord, the card displays **“Unregistered😞”**.
- An **individual points breakdown**, with each point type appearing on its own line.
- A hover overlay inviting you to view more details on **[Wise Old Man](https://wiseoldman.net/groups/11803)**.
- The **⏱️ Joined** and **Registered** dates of the member (Joined = Ingame, Registered = Discord).

At the top of the page, a summary grid displays key metrics:
- **Total Members**: The total number of active clan members.
- **Combined Total XP**: The sum of overall XP gathered from each member.
- **Combined Points**: The total of individual point values across the clan.
- **Common Progression Date**: The most frequent date members’ progressed.
- **Most Common Trained Skill**: The skill that has been updated most frequently over the past week.

Additionally, a separate **Rank Counters** grid aggregates members by rank, displaying each rank’s icon, the number of members in that rank, and tooltips listing the associated usernames.

Click any card to open that member’s profile on Wise Old Man.
